<p>This junwonsu page is show what I learn in CSE199 during first semester. first I watched video from here <a href="https://www.internet-class.org/">Learn about the internet</a>, I watched every video it was interesting for me, and fun. After I watched these videos I felt that internet is another world. Internet takes huge part from human. This CSE199 helps us what is internet and easy to understand how to use internet right way.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Group Project</h3>

<p>CSE199 class places emphasis on group project. It usually takes four people in one group. Group project was good idea for freshman because they need meet new friends and they could learn from new friends. For exmaple, I did not know how to make website, however, I asked my group partners they explained well. Sometimes only two person take in one group. I do not know why did that because I felt it is same as group four.</p>

<p>CSE199 was great class because they showed me huge internet world. They made great video and avtivities. However, some classmates said that it was bored, but I think they covered that problem with coding game. CSE199 class gives a lot of experience for students. I think thats why they think its bored.</p>
